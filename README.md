# Miner's Paradise

A (currently) small Minecraft Forge mod that adds some gadgets to make mining more exciting and efficient.

Please do **not** attempt to use this mod in your Minecraft Forge installation. It's still very much unfinished and
untested, and it's my first real attempt at making a mod. Also, please don't bother creating issues or pull requests
yet. I'll open those up when I consider this to be in a playable alpha state.
